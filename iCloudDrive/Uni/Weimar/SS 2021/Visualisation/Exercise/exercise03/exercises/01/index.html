    <h2>Exercise 1</h2>

    <section>
      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>As you have seen in the lecture, data can come in many different forms: tables, networks, fields and so on.
        In JavaScript, data is usually modelled as one or more arrays of objects with the same properties but different values.</p>
      <p>In this excercise, we will work with artificial, tablular data and focus on basic techniques to create visualisations.
        using Javascript and <a href="https://d3js.org/">d3.js</a>. </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Scales </h3>
      <p>At the very core, implementing a visualization resolves to mapping data items to visual marks and channels.
        The visualization library <a href="https://d3js.org/">d3.js</a> provides the module
        <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/README.md">d3-scale</a> to do just that. It includes scales 
        for different input and output data types and different use cases. For this section, we will focus on the linear scale, that
        will help you map the max, min, mean and standard deviation of a pool of datasets, that were already loaded for you in the 
        <code>main.js</code> file, to visual elements in the visualization below. To detmine the stats of the input data, 
        you should use the <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3-array#statistics">d3-array</a> module. 
      </p>
      <div class="task">
        <h3>Task 1: Linear Scales (25%)</h3>
        <p>Map the max and min values of the x attribute of the selected dataset to the start and end points of the line. Map the standard
          deviation of the x attribute to the position and width of the rectangle and the mean of the x attribute to the position of the circle. Include a 
          bottom axis using <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3-axis#axisBottom">d3-axis</a> to explain the mapping to the user. 
          For this, complete the function <code>boxPlot</code> in the <code>boxPlot.js</code> file.</p>
      </div>
      Choose the dataset:
      <select id="item"></select>
      <svg id="singlebox"></svg>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Join pattern</h3>
      <p>Now, we want to compare the dataset's stats directly with each other. Therefore, we need another dimension and display
        all stat visualizations at once one below the other. Here again, <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/README.md">d3-scale</a>
        will provide you with a suitable scale to calculate the vertical position of each stat visualization.
      </p>
      <p>In the task before, we reacted to user interactions by removing and reattatching all SVG elements. This,
        however, is computationally expensive and causes the browser to slow down quite a bit. Fortunately, 
        d3 has a solution to that problem: The <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3-selection#joining-data">join pattern</a> 
        allows you to specify graphical elements to be created, modified or deleted to match the given input data. </p>
      
        <div class="task">
          <h3>Task 2: Join Pattern and Categorical Scales (40%)</h3>
          <p>Create a visualization that shows the min, max, mean and standard deviation for all datasets at once. Use the join 
            pattern to reuse the SVG elements when switching between attributes. For this, complete the function 
            <code>boxPlots</code> in the <code>boxPlot.js</code> file.</p>
        </div>
        Choose the attribute for the x-axis: 
        <select id="attribute"></select>
        <svg id="barchart"></svg>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Scatterplot with Time Scale and Animation</h3>
      <p>Time-based attributes need to be treated specially due to their unusual properties. Fortunately,
        d3 provides support for mapping time-based data as well in the <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/README.md">d3-scale</a>
        module. Using these, we will have a look at how the datasets, we have created the stats visualizations
      for, actually look like by creating a scatterplot from the <b>time</b> and <b>y</b> attributes of the datasets. </p>
        <p>
          We will again use the <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3-selection#joining-data">join pattern</a> to reuse 
          the graphical elements on user interaction. To make things a little more interesting, the datapoints will 
          be animated to transition from one state to the other using another d3 module called <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3-transition">d3-transition</a>.
          In our case these transitions are simply a show case to learn how to animate the transition of an element 
          from one state to the other. In cases, where each datapoint represents one specific item and is simply shown
          in different contexts, animating transitions is neccessary to tell the user what is happening.
        </p>
        <div class="task">
          <h3>Task 3: Time Scale and Animation (35%)</h3>
          <p>Create a scatterplot of the time and y attribute of the user selected dataset. Use the join 
            pattern and animate the transition between positions when another dataset is chosen.
            For this, complete the function <code>scatterplot</code> in the <code>scatterplot.js</code> file.</p>
        </div>
        Choose the dataset: 
        <select id="dataset">
        </select>
        <svg id="scatterplot"></svg>
