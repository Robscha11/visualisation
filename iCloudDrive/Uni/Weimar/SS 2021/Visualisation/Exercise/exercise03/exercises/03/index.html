            <h3>Inspecting Data with Parallel Coordinates</h3>
            <p>As you have heared in the lecture, parallel coordinates are for  
                analysing and exploring quantitative data. In a first step, you will 
                have a look at the values and distribution of the data attributes 
                <b>releaseDate</b>, <b>revenue : budget</b>,
                <b>imdbRating</b> and <b>spokenLanguages</b> that will be discretized in 
                the next task. 
            </p>
            <div class="task">
                <h3>Task 0: Parallel Coordinates (10%)</h3>
                <p>Visualize the attributes <b>releaseDate</b>, <b>revenue : budget</b>,
                <b>imdbRating</b> and <b>spokenLanguages</b> from the 
                <a href="/data/movies.csv"><span class="monospace">movies.csv</span></a>
                as parallel coordinates.
                For that complete the function <code>calculatePaths</code> in the 
                <code>parallelcoordinates.js</code> file and examine the distributions of
                and relations between the attributes in the visualization.</p>

            <h3>Discretizing Data</h3>
            Sometimes it is necessary to find suitable transformations from ordered
            to categorical data. Thereby, it is important to find meaningful categories 
            such that the visualization will show meaningful information. The functions
            <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/README.md#threshold-scales">scaleThreshold</a>,
            <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/README.md#quantize-scales">scaleQuantize</a>,
            and
            <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3-scale/blob/master/README.md#quantile-scales">scaleQuantile</a>
            will help you with it. Here is an <a href="https://observablehq.com/@d3/quantile-quantize-and-threshold-scales">Observable notebook</a> 
            explaining all three.
            <div class="task">
                <h3>Task 1: Descretizing data (10%)</h3>
                <p>Discretize the attributes <b>releaseDate</b>, <b>revenue : budget</b>,
                <b>imdbRating</b> and <b>spokenLanguages</b> from the <a href="/data/movies.csv"><span class="monospace">movies.csv</span></a> into
                the given (or your own, if they do not suit you, but please note that the labels will be
                sorted alpha-numerically both within the parallel sets and the mosaic plot) 
                categories and write a short explanation for your choice for each attribute 
                as comment in the code. 
                For that complete the function <code>discretize</code> in the 
                <code>discretize.js</code> file and examine the result in the parallel sets 
            visualization below. The order of attributes can be changed in the <code>main.js</code>. </p>

            <h3>Slice and Dice Algorithm</h3>
            <p>The readability of the parallel sets visualization suffers from the many
            link overlaps, so another view without overlaps might be helpful. A good choice
            for an alternative view would be the mosaic plot.</p>
            <p>To create a mosaic plot view of the data in the parallel set visualization,
            the data first has to be transformed with an algorithm called <b>Slice and Dice</b>.
            </p>
            <p>The algorithm builds on the attribute hierarchy already created for the parallel
                sets in the <code>main.js</code> and is best explained via an image:</p>
            <img src="/exercises/03/SliceAndDiceAlgorithm.png" alt="slice and dice algoritm">
            <p>The slide is from this <a href="https://www.medien.ifi.lmu.de/lehre/ws1213/iv/uebung/ex6/slides_6.pdf">slide set about 
            graphs and hierarchies</a>, since the algorithm is also used to create 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treemapping">tree maps</a>.  </p>
            <p>The attribute hierarchy has already been created for you from the attributes and 
                attribute order given in the <code>main.js</code>. It contains a <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/blob/master/README.md#hierarchy">d3-hierarchy</a>,
                on top of which you can run your algorithm. These notebooks on 
                 <a href="https://observablehq.com/@d3/d3-hierarchy">the functions of a d3-hierarchy</a> and 
                 <a href="https://observablehq.com/@d3/visiting-a-d3-hierarchy">the traversal of a d3-hierarchy</a>
                will help you accomplishing the task.
            </p>
            <p>A short disclaimer: The coloring of parallel sets and mosaic plot do not match! 
                This is due to the convention in parallel sets of coloring by the first attribute
                in the hierarchy, which would not add much information to a mosaic plot, since 
                the first split is usually the most easy to see anyway. With mosaic plots, coloring 
                by the second attribute increases the readability of the rows considerably. 
                The additional opacity based on the third attribute within the hierarchy adds further 
                visual clues.
            </p>

            <div class="task">
                <h3>Task 2: Slice and Dice (50%)</h3>
                <p>Construct the rectangles needed for a mosaic plot using the 
                    slice and dice algorithm.  For this complete the 
                    <code>sliceAndDice</code> function 
                    in the <code>mosaicplot.js</code> file.
                    For a reference as to how the rectangles
                    should be represented, have a look at the dummy data used to 
                    create the initial mosaic plot.</p>

            <h3>Graph Analysis</h3>
            Parallel sets and mosaic plots have boths their strengths and weaknesses. 
            In our case, the mosaic plot gave the clearer layout due to the amount of
            overlaps in the parallel sets visualization. Let us analyse the visualizations 
            more closely.
            <div class="task">
                <h3>Task 3: what?-why?-how? (30%)</h3>
                Compare the visualizations using the what?-why?-how? framework. See 
                <a href="https://moodle.uni-weimar.de/mod/hvp/view.php?id=210570">the lecture</a>
                at 1:48 for an example. Additionally, determine the visual marks and channels
                used in each visualization.
