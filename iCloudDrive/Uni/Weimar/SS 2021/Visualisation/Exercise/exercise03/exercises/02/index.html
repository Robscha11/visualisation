            <h3>Load Data, Filter, and Format</h3>
            <p>
                Throughout the exercises we'll work with a movies dataset that is loaded from the
                <abbr title="comma-separated values">CSV</abbr> file
                <a href="/data/movies.csv"><span class="monospace">movies.csv</span></a>.
                Take a look at the file
                <span class="monospace">movies.js</span>
                in this folder to see how the data is read from the CSV.
                The result is an array of movie-objects with the attributes in the CSV which is also printed to the
                console.
                Since all attributes are treated as a string by default, the numerical attributes are converted to
                numbers and the release date is converted to JavaScript's
                <span class="monospace">Date</span>-type.
            </p>

            <div class="task">
                <h3>Task 1: Attribute Types (10%)</h3>
                <p>
                    Determine the attribute type (<i>categorical, ordinal, quantitative</i>) of the following attributes
                    from the movies dataset (or computed from it for <i>profit</i>) and also give the ordering direction
                    for ordered attributes.
                    Sometimes there is more than a single correct answer.
                    Give a short explanation for your choice in each case.
                    Write your answer into the markdown-file
                    <span class="monospace">task1.md</span>
                    in this folder and the output will be shown below.
                </p>

            <p>
                Browsing the movies-array on the console is not very user-friendly and makes it hard to quickly grasp
                the attributes.
                Let's take a look at a subset of movies by displaying a few selected attributes in a table.
                The file
                <span class="monospace">table.js</span>
                provides a function to create a table using d3.
                The table is already better readable but we can still improve readability by formatting some attributes
                and perception by adding color encoding.
            </p>

            <table id="movies"></table>

            <div class="task">
                <h3>Task 2: Formatting and Color (25%)</h3>
                <p>
                    As of now, the table shows the last ten movies from the data.
                    Go to the
                    <span class="monospace">main.js</span>
                    and instead pass the ten top-rated movies of all movies with more than 150,000 votes in descending
                    order to the table function.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Improve the formatting of each movie's runtime, rating, and number of votes by using
                    <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3-format">d3-format</a>.
                    Display the runtime (length) in hours and minutes, for example
                    <span class="monospace">1:46</span> instead of <span class="monospace">106</span>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Setup <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3-scale-chromatic">color scales</a> for the length, rating,
                    number of votes, and genres.
                    Keep the attribute types in mind and choose fitting color schemes.

            <h3>Aggregate</h3>
            <p>
                Aggregation is a reduction strategy that helps to handle complex datasets by grouping the data and
                deriving new values such as an average or a count.
                You've seen in the lecture and the first assignment that aggregation can be problematic in some cases
                but it's a powerful and important method for visualizing data that is too complex to visualize directly.
            </p>
            <p>
                Histograms visualize the approximate distribution of data by binning (or bucketing) ordered data values
                into (usually) equally sized bins.
                D3 provides
                <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3-array#bin">d3.bin</a>
                for exactly this purpose.
            </p>

            <div class="task">
                <h3>Task 3: Binning (15%)</h3>
                <p>
                    Use d3.bin to perform the binning of the movies data in the
                    <span class="monospace">histogram.js</span>.
                    Add all ordered attributes to the selection combobox to allow the selection of the attribute that is
                    binned and visualized with the histogram.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Setup the
                    <span class="monospace">tickFormat</span>
                    function to format the tick labels on the x-axis.
                    Choose a format function that fits the respective attribute.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Hint: Dates require some special treatment, see also
                    <a href="https://observablehq.com/@d3/d3-bin-time-thresholds">
                        this observable notebook
                    </a>.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <label for="binAttribute">Choose an attribute:</label>
                <select id="binAttribute"></select>
                <svg id="histogram"></svg>
            </div>

            <p>
                In contrast, bar charts have a categorical axis.
                Often, the original data cannot be used in a bar chart directly.
                Instead it has to be grouped by a category in a first step which then allows to count the data items
                or compute some other summary statistic.
                Again, d3 provides functions for these cases, namely
                <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#group">
                    <span class="monospace">d3.group</span>
                </a>
                for grouping and
                <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3-array/blob/master/README.md#rollup">
                    <span class="monospace">d3.rollup</span>
                </a>
                which applies an additional reduce-function.
                Have a look at the
                <a href="https://observablehq.com/@d3/d3-group">examples</a>
                to see how they work.
            </p>

            <div class="task">
                <h3>Task 4: Grouping (15%)</h3>
                <p>
                    Use
                    <span class="monospace">d3.rollups</span>
                    to group the movies by original language and count the number of movies per language.
                    Filter out any languages with less than ten movies to reduce clutter.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Hint: The
                    <span class="monospace">barchart</span>
                    function expects an array of objects with the properties
                    <span class="monospace">name</span> and <span class="monospace">value</span>.
                    Use
                    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map">
                        <span class="monospace">Array.map</span>
                    </a>
                    to transform the result of the rollup into this format.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hint: In this case it's easier to use
                    <span class="monospace">d3.rollups</span>
                    since it returns the result as an array instead of a
                    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map">
                        <span class="monospace">Map</span>
                    </a>
                    which makes it easier to filter and sort the results afterwards.

            <h3>Faceting and Coordination</h3>
            <p>
                As you've learned in the lecture, faceting makes it easier to handle visual complexity.
                Let's have a look at the different genres that occur in our movie dataset.
                We'll create small multiples by juxtaposing similar views on different subsets of the data, namely all
                movies that contain a genre.
                An additional overview provides the context of all movies and navigation on the time axis.
                The selected range of years is then propagated to the individual views and thereby provides coordination.
                The file <span class="monospace">smallMultiples.js</span> creates small multiples for the genres.
                However, you have to transform the movies data into the required data structures first.
            </p>

            <div class="task">
                <h3>Task 5: Small Multiples (35%)</h3>
                <p>
                    Go to the file
                    <span class="monospace">smallMultiples.js</span>.
                    Populate the array
                    <span class="monospace">genres</span>
                    with the unique genres in the dataset.
                    Create a map
                    <span class="monospace">moviesPerYear</span>
                    of all movies grouped by the release year with an object that holds the average rating of all movies
                    in that year in the property
                    <span class="monospace">mean</span>
                    and the number of movies that year in the property
                    <span class="monospace">count</span>.
                    Create another map
                    <span class="monospace">moviesByGenrePerYear</span>
                    with each genre as the key
                    and the the same structure as
                    <span class="monospace">moviesPerYear</span>
                    as the value but limited
                    to the subset of movies with that respective genre.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Setup the color scale <span class="monospace">color</span> that maps the movie count to a color.
                    Choose a suitable color scheme.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hint: You can use
                    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/getFullYear">
                        <span class="monospace">Date.getFullYear</span>
                    </a>
                    to get the year of a date.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hint: Since each movies is not restricted to a single genre but has an array of genres, you cannot
                    simply use a stacked call to d3.rollup.
                    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach"><span
                            class="monospace">Array.forEach</span></a> and
                    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map/forEach"><span
                            class="monospace">Map.forEach</span></a> can be used to iterate over the values of an array
                    and the entries of map respectively.
                    In fact,
                    <span class="monospace">d3.group</span>
                    and
                    <span class="monospace">d3.rollup</span>
                    iterate over the values internally to create their result as well.
                    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/includes"><span
                            class="monospace">Array.includes</span></a> can be used to check if an array contains a
                    specific value.
